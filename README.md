# Retropie instructions

## Overview

The [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) is a credit card-sized single-board computer. Installed on it is [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/) which allows for playing older games on various consoles via an emulator.

There are [104 NES games installed](installed-nes.md) currently out of [691 available NES games](available-nes.md).

There are [106 SNES games installed](installed-snes.md) currently out of [764 available SNES games](available-snes.md).

Feel free to let me know if you'd like to any additional roms installed. I've found that installing all of them adds so much noise that it impedes finding the game your tryng to play. I recommend only installing the ones you actually plan on playing.

## Getting started

Setting up the Retropie is relatively straightforward:

1. Plug included HDMI cable into the HDMI port on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the opposite end of the HDMI cable to your television or monitor, ensuring that the correct input is selected.
3. Connect the included USB game controller to the Raspberry Pi.
4. Connect the micro USB power adapter to the Raspberry Pi.
5. Wait for the system to boot (a few seconds).
6. Using the game controller, select a console and press the A button.
7. Using the game controller, select a game to play and press the A button.
8. Do not press any buttons on the game controller until the game loads.
9. Play away.

## Navigating the system

Certain button combinations on the game controller allow you to perform a variety of important functions. These combinations will work even while a game is playing.

## More roms

[Emuparadise](http://www.emuparadise.me/roms-isos-games.php) is a decent provider of ROMs for several different consoles. This page does a good job explaining [how to transfer ROMs to your Retropie](https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/Transferring-Roms).
